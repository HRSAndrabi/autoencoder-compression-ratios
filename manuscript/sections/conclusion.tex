% Conclusion


In this paper, I evaluate the capacity of various autoencoder network architectures to compress and subsequently reconstruct high-dimensional images of handwritten digits.
I assess the reconstruction accuracy of 14 distinct autoencoders architectures, each imposing a distinct combination of compression ratio and bias-unit parameterisations.
The obtained results show that reconstruction accuracy of encoded images monotonically diminishes with the imposition of higher compression-ratios.
Moreover, the accuracy with which autoencoder networks reproduce input images is shown to depend on the complexity of structures in the original image.
Finally, the inclusion or exclusion of bias units within autoencoder network architectures is documented to inconsistently affect accuracy of image reconstruction.
